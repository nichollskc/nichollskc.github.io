I am a PhD student in Mathematics, Genomics and Medicine at the University of Cambridge, funded by the Wellcome Trust.

My PhD involves data science in large genomic datasets, with the aim of finding links between immune-mediated diseases.

I have a great interest in programming, and have kept up good software practices even in research code. I have also worked on many [side projects](/other/) in my spare time in languages from Haskell to Rust.

## PhD University of Cambridge 2019-2023 (January)

The main projects in my PhD are:

- [Comparison of biclustering algorithms](research/biclustering/biclust_comp/) using snakemake pipeline
- Clique-community detection in graphs (C++)
- Clustering points with measurement error with MCMC sampler implemented in C++

## MRes University of Cambridge 2018-2019

During my MRes year I studied a number of courses in Machine Learning, Statistics, Biology, Genomics and Bioinformatics. I also completed two research rotations.

The first was a starting point for my current PhD project in constructing gene regulatory networks with Chris Wallace, MRC Biostatistics Unit, and Ken Smith, CITIID, Department of Medicine.

The second was feature design for predicting whether two peptide fragments will bind together, with potential application in research in Alzheimer's Disease. This was a joint project with Michele Vendrusculo at the Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Chemistry, Pietro Lio' in Computer Science and Paul Kirk in MRC Biostatistics Unit.

## Before Cambridge

I studied Mathematics (MMath) at the University of Oxford from 2012-2016, focusing on pure mathematics in the early years but with a greater focus on statistics in later years. I think the greatest skill I gained from this degree was the ability to look at a dense page of information, none of which I understand, and slowly work out its meaning piece by piece. I have found this a useful skill when studying in many different fields, and in programming.

I've always had an interest in coding. In 2015 I completed a summer internship at a software engineering company and started a job at the same company after my graduation in 2016. I learned how to code in C and python and improved key coding skills such as design and test generation.
